- Load balancing using multiple paths.
- Flow timeout and removal.
- Dynamic flow rule modification.
- Handling network topology changes.
- Implementing multipath routing.
- Quality of Service (QoS) management.
- Link failure detection and recovery.
- Port mirroring for traffic analysis.

## SDN Controllers
SDN controllers provide centralized network management. This environment includes tests for:
- Basic setup and configuration of Ryu, OpenDaylight, Floodlight, and ONOS controllers.
- Controller failover testing.
- Multi-controller setup and interaction.
- Northbound and southbound API interactions.
- Custom SDN application deployment.
